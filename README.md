#### Hacktoberfest-2016-Game

# Hacktoberfest Hunt


##### Game Description:
  
The game consists of a chessboard-like field with the 'Hacktoberfest' word hidden.
Each time the user selects a tile, it will flip and show the content under it.
The tile will either display a cross sign or a letter in place of the 'Hacktoberfest' word. There
will be a player and an opponent (bot or friend). The person who strikes all the words
first will win the prize (i.e. prize will be displayed as Hactoberfest t-shirt).

##### Rules:

1. Only one tile can be selected at a time.
2. The person who selects the tile with correct letters of the word will get another turn.
3. The person who selects all the letters of 'Hacktoberfest' will win the game.

##### Special Moves/Items:

There are three items that represent special moves:
  - ITEM 1: allows you to play an extra turn even though the guess was wrong
  - ITEM 2: allows you to flip the position of tiles before the other user can perform their moves
  - ITEM 3: provides a hint at the opponents tile positions
Each move can be used only once.

*Each move can be used only once.*

##### Notes: 

Instead of the classic chessboard tiles, this game will emplement Digital Ocean's cloud logo. The logo can be used in different colors.
Hacktoberfest stickers can be used to represent the special move indicators.
